# Reinforcement Learning on Robots

This project was part of a self-directed elective in my final year of undergrad to learn the fundamentals of reinforcement learning. I explored implementing approximate temporal difference learning algorithms on physical custom 3D printed robots, Benny and Bunny, to move from A to B. Halfway through the project, it became clear the algorithms and hardware had to be decoupled as it was too difficult to verify if the problems lay in the hardware or the algorithms. From the simulation results, it became clear the selected algorithms would not work for a large state space, and more powerful algorithms would be needed to teach the robots Benny and Bunny path planning from A to B.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
